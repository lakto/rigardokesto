#### Hi there I'm André

Web and applications developer from Switzerland with a passion for digital preservation and creativity. I studied Cultural and Media Studies and Computer Science at the University of Basel, and wrote my PhD thesis in Digital Humanities. Today, I work as an archival computer scientist / digital archivist in Solothurn, where I help to ensure the long-term preservation of digital data.

In my spare time, I enjoy building my own furniture, sewing clothes and accessories, and taking photographs. I publish my creative projects here on my [website][website], on [unsplash][unsplash] or on [github][github].

I am passionate about using technology to preserve and share our cultural heritage, and to inspire creativity in others. I am also a strong advocate for open access and open source software.
